Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy.default must be replaced
-/+ resource "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy" "default" {
      ~ id          = "my-policy-name" -> (known after apply)
      ~ policy      = jsonencode( # whitespace changes
            {
                rules = [
                    {
                        action       = {
                            type = "expire"
                        }
                        description  = "Expire images more than 60 versions old"
                        rulePriority = 1
                        selection    = {
                            countNumber = 60
                            countType   = "imageCountMoreThan"
                            tagStatus   = "any"
                        }
                    },
                ]
            }
        )
      ~ registry_id = "0001000200030004" -> (known after apply)
      ~ repository  = "repo-name-1" -> "repo-name-2" # forces replacement
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
